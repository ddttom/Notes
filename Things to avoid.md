Things to avoid

Toasts, fades, item removal, below the fold error messages. Hiding divs until previous dive complete. Give error messages as you go not after submit. Have a clear response page not just a spa. Avoid too much spa. Not possible for a human focused site. Know if you are being used by an AI bot. Adjust your UI to accelerate AI engagement. Personalisation for robots.

Animation for AI is not great experience.

Floating loading and spinners are not good UI for an AI.

Don't assume an AI agent will read your console. Anything you need an AI to know should be visible and obvious. Hide nothing in disclaimers.
