+## Frontend-Backend Separation
+
+### Communication Principles
+
+- Frontend only knows connectors are available and expected schema
+- Backend strictly follows schema without UI knowledge
+- Schema index is the collaboration point between developer and AI
+
+## Database Approach
+
+- Use NoSQL database approach to avoid SQL migration problems
+- Provides flexibility and easier schema evolution
+
+## Development Practices
+
+### Git Attribution
+
+- Ensure proper attribution in all git commits
+- Especially important for AI-assisted code
+
+### Refactoring
+
+- Consider implementing a refactoring command
+- Regularly review opportunities to improve code structure
